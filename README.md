# Election Results
 
## Project Overview
Contracted by the Colorado Board of Elections to develop an automated auditing system to certify the results of a recent local congressional election.  Project deliverables include the following:  

  1. Tabulate and report the total number of votes cast.
  2. Obtain a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate and report the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate and report the percentage of votes each candidate received.
  5. Determine and report the winner of the election based upon popular vote.
  6. Calculate and report the voter turnout for each county. 
  7. Calculate and report the percentage of votes from each county.
  8. Report the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Summary
Python coding was used to extract polling data and generate election results in a simple and concise manner.  The audit confirmed previous methodology and is recommended to be scaled to additional elections.  In order to successfully accomplish scale-up, data must be tabulated in similar format. Otherwise, coding must be modified to properly extract data.  In addition, multiple libraries need to be built and maintained containing data from the various counties and municipalities.  Data structures and security measures must be established prior to program roll-out.
